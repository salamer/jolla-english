# Jolla
jolla is a pure API server framework,and it is based on the gevent.

When I wrote Jolla,what I want to do is a high performance API server for you to simply obey its short rule,and get your calculation result fast be sent to browser or mobile for your service.so I made Jolla as simple as possible.

Hope you guys like it.
